## Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used in web development. It allows you to create dynamic and interactive web pages, manage data, and handle asynchronous operations. This documentation provides an introduction to JavaScript and covers some of the most fundamental data types in the language, including Arrays and Objects.

## Array Data Type

An **Array** in JavaScript is a collection of items stored in a single variable. Arrays can store multiple values, which can be of different data types, such as numbers, strings, or even other objects. Arrays are ordered, meaning the order of the elements is preserved.

JavaScript provides various methods to work with arrays, such as adding, removing, and iterating over elements.

---

## Object Data Type

An **Object** in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (also known as a property), and the value can be any data type (such as numbers, strings, arrays, or even other objects). Objects are often used to represent real-world entities like users, cars, or books.

Objects allow you to store and manage data in a structured way, and you can easily access or modify the values associated with different properties.
